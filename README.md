Hi! I am a self-taught programmer with no formal computer science classes.

I've done Lua (Roblox), Python, C# (Unity, .NET MAUI, .NET Backend), C, and C++.

Currently learning MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)

I'm interested in video game development and am currently working on my programming language in C++
